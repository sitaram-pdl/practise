            How a Sustainable Website Works
          </h5>
          <p className={`card-text ${classes['card-text']}`}>
            Many people fail to realise how digital products have an impact on
            the environment. Internet- connected devices produce global
            emissions, and the number of emissions is expected to rise with
            people going online.

            Easier to Find with Fewer Pages <br />
            Make it easier for visitors to find what they need on your site. The
            fewer pages they have to navigate and visit, the fewer server
